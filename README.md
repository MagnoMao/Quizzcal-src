Hello.  
This is the source files of a quizz app that I created to practice and showcase my react skills.  
It's a readable version before the files are digested by the react-app to create the production build.  
This quizz app gets the data from the [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/) api.  
Everything was coded from scratch.  

It's the final challenge from a [react course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8) where the challenge was "Hey create a quizz app using this API" and "Here have this layout so you can use as a reference"  

You can access the app at https://magnomao.github.io/  
And the digested code that generates the site at https://github.com/MagnoMao/MagnoMao.github.io

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
